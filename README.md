# Machine's database Converter 

Hello Everyone,
I have made this program to convert the automatic calling machine's database (which is a .mdb file) to json format on based on a SQL condition whether the feedback was answered or not.

It will store all the names and numbers of people who have answered our Automated Call.
Also I have created a GUI Interface to give the user a good experience and created an executale file using pyinstaller.
